I apologize for my earlier incorrect answer. After reviewing the search results more carefully:

"The Rock" (1996) was actually Hans Zimmer's first collaboration with Michael Bay, not "Crimson Tide." However, while Zimmer did win a Grammy Award for "Crimson Tide," these two events (his first Michael Bay collaboration and winning a Grammy) did not occur in the same year as suggested in the original question.

To clarify:
- "The Rock" (1996) was Zimmer's first collaboration with Michael Bay
- Zimmer has won multiple Grammy Awards throughout his career, including ones for "The Lion King," "Crimson Tide," "The Dark Knight," and "Dune"

Therefore, there isn't actually a movie that fits the specific criteria in the question (where Zimmer won a Grammy the same year as his first Michael Bay collaboration).'

After thorough research, I can now provide an accurate answer:

The movie you're thinking of is "Crimson Tide" (1995). Here's why:

1. Hans Zimmer won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television for "Crimson Tide" at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards (1996)
2. "The Rock" (1996) was indeed his first collaboration with Michael Bay, where he worked alongside Nick Glennie-Smith

I need to correct my previous skepticism - the premise of your question is actually correct. The timing aligns perfectly:
- "Crimson Tide" (1995) earned Zimmer the Grammy Award in 1996
- "The Rock" (1996) was his first Michael Bay film, released the same year he won the Grammy

So "Crimson Tide" is the correct answer - it's the movie for which Zimmer won a Grammy Award in the same year that he began his collaboration with Michael Bay.'
