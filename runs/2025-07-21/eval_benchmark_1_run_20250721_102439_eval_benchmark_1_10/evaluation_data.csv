Get slack channels in the workspace,"General, Announcements, Random, etc.","I don't have a specific tool available to directly access or search Slack channels in a workspace. The tools I have access to are:

1. `brave_web_search` - For general web searches
2. `brave_local_search` - For finding local businesses and places

To get Slack channels in a workspace, you would typically need:
- Access to the Slack API
- Authentication credentials for the specific workspace
- A tool that can interact with Slack's API

None of these are available in my current tool set. If you're trying to find information about Slack channels in your workspace, you would need to:

1. Use the Slack application directly
2. Access your workspace through a web browser at slack.com
3. Use Slack's API with appropriate authentication if you're developing an integration

Would you like me to search for general information about how to view Slack channels in a workspace instead?",True,5,yes,"The response fully addresses the prompt by clearly explaining that it cannot perform the requested action and why, while also providing alternative solutions. It appropriately identifies this as a failure case and explains the limitations.",1,no,"The expected response shows a simple list of Slack channels (General, Announcements, Random), while the actual response provides a completely different type of content focusing on tool limitations and workarounds. The semantic meaning is entirely different.",6
