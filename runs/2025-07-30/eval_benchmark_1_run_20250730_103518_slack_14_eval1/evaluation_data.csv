Would you like me to:
1. Search for any projects or repositories associated with John Smith?
2. Look for any issues or merge requests he's involved in?
3. Check if there are any other details available about his GitLab activity?

12,Get me recent messages from the trump-supporters channel,"I searched through all the channels in your Slack workspace, and I couldn't find a channel named ""trump-supporters"". The channel list doesn't contain any channel with that name.

general
random
tech-related channels
project-specific channels
team channels
social channels (like pet-pics, foodlovers, games, etc.)

Double-check the channel name - it might be slightly different
Verify that you have access to this channel

- **operating-model**
- **10x-and-cxnpl**
- **q2-constantinople** 
- **tech**

It's possible that:
1. The ""trump-supporters"" channel doesn't exist in this workspace
2. It might be a private channel that you don't have access to
3. It could be archived or deleted
