0,Can you list all Slack channels related to our ongoing banking software project?,,"I apologize for the error when trying to retrieve more channels. Let's work with the information we have so far.

Based on the channels I was able to see, here are the ones that might be related to your banking software project:

1. **tech** (C03L9N39805) - A general technology channel that might discuss technical aspects of your banking software.
2. **q2-constantinople** (C03JF7B8U69) - This appears to be a project-specific channel, possibly named after a quarterly milestone or project phase.
3. **10x-and-cxnpl** (C03DMU28597) - This could be related to customer experience and product development for your banking platform.
4. **operating-model** (C0374RE85GV) - This might discuss operational aspects of your banking software.

To get more specific information about any of these channels, I could:
1. Look at the channel history to confirm if they're discussing your banking software project
2. Check if there are specific users involved who are known to be working on the banking project

Would you like me to check the recent messages in any of these channels to confirm if they're related to your banking software project?",True,False,"{'score': 0, 'reasoning': 'The response does not use the slack_list_channels tool at all.
